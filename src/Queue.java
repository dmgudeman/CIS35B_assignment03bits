/*
 * ReentrantLock is mutual exclusive lock, similar to implicit
 * locking provided by synchronized keyword in Java, with extended
 * feature like fairness, which can be used to provide lock to
 * longest waiting thread. Lock is acquired by lock() method and
 * held by Thread until a call to unlock() method. Fairness  parameter
 * is provided while creating instance of ReentrantLock in constructor.
 *
 * The main difference between synchronized and ReentrantLock is ability
 * to trying for lock interruptibly, and with timeout. Thread doesn√≠t need
 * to block infinitely, which was the case with synchronized.
